# CLAUDE.md — Vision Graphics Kft. Website

## Project Overview

Company website for **Vision Graphics Kft.** (visiongraphics.eu).
Budapest-based architectural visualization studio, founded 1996.
Solo operator: **László Kerezsi** — 30+ years in 3ds Max, deep AI integration,
Unreal Engine VR, custom scripting/automation.

Live dev reference: https://dev.visiongraphics.eu (WordPress prototype — do NOT copy its bugs)
Target: rebuild in Astro, deploy to Cloudflare Pages.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Astro 5.x (static output in prod, server in dev) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v3 |
| Interactivity | React islands (`client:load`) |
| Content | Astro Content Collections + Keystatic CMS |
| Content format | MDX (all collections) + YAML metadata (reference collections) |
| Search | Pagefind (post-build, static) |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages (staging: visiongraphics-astro.pages.dev) |
| Image Storage | Cloudflare R2 bucket: `visiongraphics-images` |
| CI/CD | GitHub → Cloudflare Pages (auto-deploy on push to master) |

---

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # dev server (localhost:4321) — server mode, Keystatic at /keystatic
npm run build        # production static build + Pagefind index
npm run preview      # preview built output
```

**Dev vs Prod output:**
- `dev` → `output: 'server'` + Node adapter (required for Keystatic write API)
- `build` → `output: 'static'` (Cloudflare Pages compatible, Keystatic excluded)

---

## Content Management

Two editors are available in dev mode:
- **VG Editor** (primary) — `http://localhost:4323/` — custom block-based editor with R2 image upload
- **Keystatic CMS** (fallback) — `http://localhost:4321/keystatic` — schema-driven MDX editor

VG Editor runs two processes: `npm run editor:server` (API, port varies) + `npm run editor:client` (UI, port 4323).
Image uploads via VG Editor go to local `.staging/<slug>/`, then "↑ R2" pushes to R2 via rclone.

### VG Editor — AI Tab

The left panel **AI** tab integrates two local AI services:

**Ollama** (text generation)
- Status dot shows availability; model dropdown populated from Ollama's tag list.
- Quick actions: generate excerpt from page content, free-form prompt.
- The selected model here is also used by the SwarmUI panel's ✦ Generate block workflow.

**SwarmUI** (image generation)
- Connects to a SwarmUI instance (not ComfyUI directly — SwarmUI wraps the backend).
- **Model** — text input with datalist autocomplete from SwarmUI's model list (`f.name` — the internal filename identifier, not display title); saved models persist in `editor-config.json`. "↻ Fetch models" pulls the list from SwarmUI.
- **Steps / CFG / Sampler / Scheduler** — generation parameters shown in a compact row below the model field. Defaults: steps = 4, CFG = 1, sampler = euler, scheduler = simple (tuned for LCM/Lightning/Turbo models).
- **Size** — base resolution: 1024 / 1328 / 1536 / 2048. Total pixel count equals `base²` (same megapixel budget as 1:1 at that size).
- **Format** — aspect ratio: 21:9 / 2:1 / 16:9 / 1:1 / 9:16. Both dimensions calculated from `sqrt(area × ratio)`, rounded to nearest 8px.
- **Style** — saved named styles (positive prompt suffixes). Appended to the prompt at generation time, not mixed into the textarea. Save current prompt as a new style; load style text into prompt via ↓.
- **Prompt** — textarea. "Save…" names and saves the prompt to `swarmPrompts` in config. "Load prompt…" dropdown restores a saved prompt.
- **☰ Blocks / ✦ Generate** — Ollama-powered banner subject workflow:
  - "☰ Blocks" activates **AI block selection mode** on the canvas. A green banner appears at the top of the canvas; blocks get checkbox overlays; normal drag/toolbar is hidden.
  - Click blocks in the canvas to toggle selection (green border + tint = selected). Click "✕ Exit" in the banner or "☰ Blocks" again to cancel.
  - "✦ Generate" sends the selected blocks' extracted text to Ollama (using the model selected in the Ollama panel above). The result is written into the SwarmUI prompt field.
  - When blocks are selected, **only block text is sent** — page meta (title/description/tags) is intentionally excluded so the LLM derives from the actual selection. Falls back to page meta only if no blocks are selected.
  - If no text can be extracted from the selected blocks, an error is shown rather than hallucinating from meta.
  - While Ollama is processing, a preview of the extracted text (first 120 chars) is shown below "Asking Ollama…" so you can verify what was sent.
- **Generated images** are downloaded from SwarmUI and saved to `tools/editor/.swarmui-output/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.jpg` (JPEG, no EXIF). Served at `/api/swarmui/output/<filename>`. Last 12 thumbnails shown as a gallery strip; click to re-display.

**Block text extraction** (`extractText` in `ComfyUIPanel.tsx`):
Handles `props.text`, `props.html` (strips tags), `props.label`, `props.title`, `props.heading`, `props.content`, `props.desc`, `props.caption`. Recurses into `children`, `left`, `right`, `items`, `rows`, `blocks`. Plain strings in arrays (e.g. `results-list` items) are handled directly. Falls back to the raw object if no `props` wrapper.

**Prompt Settings** (collapsible section in the AI tab)
- **System Prompts** — named, saved system prompts. One can be active at a time. The active system prompt is prepended to both the banner-subject generation and the Ollama chat, overriding the task-specific prompt. Dropdown to select active; textarea to edit; Update / Save as… / ✕ delete. Changing the active selection saves immediately.
- **Task Prompts** — per-endpoint editable system instructions. Each row shows `default` or `✎ custom` (red) and can be expanded to edit. Clicking Save overwrites; Reset to default clears back to built-in. Endpoints covered:
  - `bannerSubject` — system instruction for block → image prompt generation. Default: *"Extract the essence of the following text, and synthetize it as an image. Describe the subject of this image in 3-4 sentences. Only write about the subject, and nothing about the style and the composition."*
  - `chat` — system context for the free-form Ollama chat panel
  - `excerpt` — instruction for excerpt generation
  - `caption` — instruction for SectionBanner label + title suggestions (must keep LABEL:/TITLE: format)
  - `paragraph` — system context for paragraph writing/rewriting
  - `summaryDescription` / `summaryStory` / `summaryTasks` — per-field instructions for summary generation

**AI Settings** (collapsible section at the bottom of the AI tab)
- Ollama address (default `http://localhost:11434`)
- SwarmUI address (default `http://localhost:7801`)
- "Save & reconnect" writes to `tools/editor/editor-config.json` and re-checks service availability.

**`tools/editor/editor-config.json`** — persists all AI settings between server restarts:
```json
{
  "ollamaBase": "http://localhost:11434",
  "swarmBase":  "http://192.168.x.x:7801",
  "swarmBases": ["http://192.168.x.x:7801", "http://second-machine:7801"],
  "swarmModels":  ["modelName/file.safetensors"],
  "swarmStyles":  [{ "name": "Cinematic BW", "text": "black and white, cinematic..." }],
  "swarmPrompts": [{ "name": "Glass Tower", "text": "lone glass tower at dusk..." }],
  "ollamaSystemPrompts": [{ "name": "Art Director", "text": "You are an art director..." }],
  "activeSystemPromptName": "Art Director",
  "ollamaTaskPrompts": { "bannerSubject": "...", "chat": "...", "excerpt": "..." }
}
```

`swarmBases` is the active list of backends (added 2026-05). `swarmBase` is kept for backward compatibility — when only `swarmBase` is set, the server treats it as a single-element list. The AI Settings panel writes both fields on save (`swarmBase` mirrors the first entry of `swarmBases`).

**SwarmUI setup requirements:**
- Host must listen on `0.0.0.0` (not `127.0.0.1`) to accept network connections.
- Default port: 7801. Set the editor's SwarmUI address accordingly.
- No WS bridge — generation uses SwarmUI's blocking HTTP API (`POST /API/GenerateText2Image`), so long generations simply hold the HTTP connection open (up to 3 min timeout).
- Model identifiers must be the internal `name` field from `ListModels` (the filename path), not the display `title`.

**Multi-backend SwarmUI:**
- Multiple `swarmBases` entries are addressed round-robin per image when a multi-image request is generated. E.g. with 2 backends and 4 images, each backend gets 2 generation jobs in parallel.
- `/api/swarmui/status` pings every backend in parallel and returns `{ available: <any-up>, backends: [{ base, available }] }`.
- `/api/swarmui/models` walks the list and returns the first reachable backend's model list (assumes a shared model set).
- If any backend returns an error, that backend's images are skipped and the others still complete; the response includes a `warnings` field listing per-backend failures.

**Async generate in the AI panel:**
- The Generate button is no longer disabled while a generation is in flight. Clicking again queues another concurrent generation; with multi-backend setups these run in parallel on different machines.
- The button label flips to `Generate · N running…` while jobs are active; the count below shows how many are queued. Each completed job appends its images to the output panel (rather than replacing — click "Clear" to reset).

**Lightbox in the AI panel:**
- Clicking any output image or any thumbnail in the Recent gallery opens a full-window lightbox overlay. Click outside the image, click ✕, or press Escape to close.
- Shift-click a gallery thumbnail to load it back into the output panel above (preserves the old click behaviour).

**Ollama NDJSON quirk:** Ollama sometimes returns streaming NDJSON even with `stream: false`. All server-side Ollama calls use `ollamaGenerate()` which aggregates all chunk `response` fields when multiple lines are returned, ensuring the full response is captured regardless of streaming behaviour.

**VG Editor block palette — auto-registry:**
The block palette is filtered per page type based on what components are actually registered
in the Astro page templates. The editor server exposes `GET /api/registry` which scans
the four content templates (`portfolio/[slug].astro`, `services/[slug].astro`,
`vision-tech/[slug].astro`, `articles/[slug].astro`) at request time, extracts the
`<Content components={{ ... }}>` prop, and maps component names → editor block types.
The palette fetches this on load and shows only blocks valid for the open page type.
Falls back to showing all blocks if no document is open or the fetch fails.

When adding a new MDX component to the editor:
1. Create the Astro `.astro` component
2. Import and add it to `<Content components={{ ... }}>` in the relevant template(s)
3. Add the VG Editor block: client types, client registry, server types, block-mapper, codegen, UI component, blocks/index.tsx
4. Add the component name → block type mapping to `tools/editor/server/lib/astro-registry-scanner.ts`
The palette will automatically show the new block only on page types where its Astro component is registered.

**VG Editor toolbar tabs:**
- **Editor** — block-based content editor (default view)
- **Pages** — enable/disable and reorder nav items (drag-to-reorder, saved to `src/data/nav-config.json`)
- **Pricing** — edit everything on `/pricing/`. Two sections:
  - *Pricing Packages* — the three cards (name, price, description, included bullets, CTA, highlight flag); add/remove/reorder. Saved to `src/data/pricing-packages.json`.
  - *Reference Pricing* — the line-item price table below the cards. Editable: intro, footer note, categories (title + reorder + add/remove), and per-row code/item/value with reorder + add/remove. Saved to `src/data/pricing-reference.json`.
- **Projects** — batch toggle Published / Featured per project; Open button loads file into editor
- **Articles** — batch toggle Published, inline tag editor; Open button loads file into editor; ⟳ per-row thumb generation
- **Services** — batch toggle Published; Open button loads file into editor; ⟳ per-row thumb generation
- **Vision-Tech** — batch toggle Published; Open button loads file into editor; ⟳ per-row thumb generation
- **Collections** — manage reference collections (clients, designers, cities, countries, client-types, categories)

**VG Editor toolbar push buttons:**
- **↑ Git** — always commits any pending changes and pushes to the **`develop` branch** (regardless of currently checked-out branch — switches to develop first if needed). Updates the staging URL `develop.visiongraphics-astro.pages.dev` (and `staging.visiongraphics.eu` once the custom domain is wired up).
- **↑ Live** — promotes `develop` → `master` (publish to production). Yellow-bordered button with a confirmation dialog. Sequence: commits any pending edits to develop → pushes develop → checks out master → pulls master with `--ff-only` → merges develop with `--no-ff` (creates an explicit `release: ...` merge commit) → pushes master → checks out develop. The `master` push triggers a Cloudflare Pages production deploy to `visiongraphics.eu`.

The `master` branch should never be edited directly from the editor — always go through `develop` and use **↑ Live** when ready to publish.

### Keystatic Config

`keystatic.config.ts` in project root. Defines all collection schemas.

**CRITICAL — Keystatic projects MDX field has NO components registered.**
Registering `fields.array(fields.object())` schemas (e.g. `imageGalleryComponent`) in
`content: fields.mdx({ components: {...} })` for the projects collection causes a
ProseMirror `createAndFill` crash that blocks the entire editor page. Root cause: the
inline JSX prop format used in existing MDX files (`images={[{...}]}`) is incompatible
with Keystatic's internal ProseMirror node representation of array/object schemas.
**Do not add component schemas back to the projects `fields.mdx({})` call.**
Body text and all frontmatter fields are still fully editable; component blocks appear
as opaque embeds (preserved on save, not visually editable in Keystatic UI).

### MDX Components (for use in content files)

```
src/components/mdx/
  SectionBanner.astro       — section divider with label + title + background image
  ImageGallery.astro        — lightbox image grid
  ImageCompare.astro        — before/after slider
  DeliverableGrid.astro     — card grid for services (2 or 3 columns)
  TimelineTable.astro       — project phase table for services
  NotableGrid.astro         — two-column list of notable projects
  ProcessFlow.astro         — horizontal step diagram with optional feedback arc (services + vision-tech)
  PhaseMatrix.astro         — dot matrix: deliverable types × project phases (services)
  SingleImage.astro         — single image with click-to-fullscreen (reuses ImageLightbox)
  SpecTable.astro           — 2-column spec table: label | value (vision-tech)
  CompareTable.astro        — multi-column comparison table: feature × option (vision-tech)
  ProjectDescription.astro  — description text block (children, no props)
  ProjectStory.astro        — story/background section (heading prop + children)
  ProjectTasks.astro        — tasks text block (children, no props)
```

Also usable in project MDX (registered in portfolio template):
```
Tour360      — click-to-load 360° iframe
YoutubeEmbed — click-to-load YouTube facade
FilmEmbed    — Vimeo facade
```

Also usable in service MDX (registered in service template):
```
Tour360      — click-to-load 360° iframe
YoutubeEmbed — click-to-load YouTube facade
ProcessFlow  — workflow diagram
PhaseMatrix  — phase × deliverable matrix
NotableGrid  — two-column list of notable projects
ImageGallery — lightbox image grid
ImageCompare — before/after slider
```

Also usable in vision-tech MDX (registered in vision-tech template):
```
Tour360      — click-to-load 360° iframe
YoutubeEmbed — click-to-load YouTube facade
ImageCompare — before/after slider
ImageGallery — lightbox image grid
ProcessFlow  — workflow diagram
SpecTable    — 2-column spec table: rows={[{ label, value }]} caption?
CompareTable — multi-column comparison: headers={[...]} rows={[{ label, values:[...] }]} caption?
```

Usage in MDX:
```jsx
<SectionBanner image="/_img/banners/banner-general.jpg" label="Label" title="Title" />
<DeliverableGrid columns={3} items={[{ title: "...", desc: "..." }]} />
<TimelineTable rows={[{ scope: "...", deliverables: "..." }]} />
<NotableGrid items={[{ name: "...", year: "..." }]} />
<ImageGallery images={[{ src: "...", alt: "..." }]} />
<SingleImage src="/_img/..." alt="..." />
<SingleImage src="/_img/..." alt="..." caption="Optional caption" />
<Tour360 url="https://pano.visiongraphics.eu/SLUG/" title="Description" />
<YoutubeEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID" title="Description" />

{/* Project text blocks — use children, NOT a text prop */}
<ProjectTasks>
Tasks paragraph one.

Tasks paragraph two.
</ProjectTasks>

<ProjectStory heading="The Story:">
Background paragraph one.
</ProjectStory>
```

**CRITICAL — ProjectStory/ProjectTasks/ProjectDescription use children, not props.**
Never write `<ProjectStory text={`...`} />` — Keystatic will corrupt it on save.
Always use the opening/closing tag form with content as children.

MDX components must be passed via the `components` prop in the page template:
```astro
const { Content } = await entry.render();
<Content components={{ SectionBanner, DeliverableGrid, ProjectStory, ProjectTasks, ... }} />
```

**Note on `YoutubeEmbed` casing:** The component file is `YouTubeEmbed.astro` but MDX
content uses `<YoutubeEmbed>`. Both are registered in templates via alias:
`{ YouTubeEmbed, YoutubeEmbed: YouTubeEmbed }`.

### Multi-Section Project MDX Pattern

Complex projects (hotels, residential with multiple unit types, multi-building schemes)
use repeated `SectionBanner + ImageGallery + Tour360` blocks to group content:

```mdx
{/* Opening gallery — no banner needed */}
<ImageGallery images={[...exterior images...]} />

{/* Each section: banner → gallery → optional tour */}
<SectionBanner image="/_img/portfolio/slug/30.jpg" label="Apartment" title="C-401" />
<ImageGallery images={[...apartment images...]} />
<Tour360 url="https://pano.visiongraphics.eu/SLUG_C401/" title="Apartment C-401 — 360°" />
```

Image numbering: R2 images are sequential (`01.jpg`, `02.jpg`… `09.jpg`, `10.jpg`…
`99.jpg`, `100.jpg`). Section split points map directly to this sequence.
Use the dev site to count images per section.

## Internationalization (i18n)

Site supports **English (default)** and **Hungarian** with symmetric URL prefixes
(`/en/...` and `/hu/...`). Designed so adding `de` later is a 3-file change.

### Locale list — single source of truth in 3 places

To add or remove a locale, update **all three** in lockstep:
1. `src/lib/i18n.ts` — `LOCALES` constant + `Locale` type
2. `src/content/config.ts` — the `localizedString()` helper's object branch
3. `tools/editor/client/src/lib/localized.ts` — `LOCALES` constant
4. `astro.config.mjs` — `i18n.locales` array

### Routing

All page templates live under `src/pages/[lang]/...`. The bare-root
`src/pages/index.astro` redirects 308 → `/en/`. Legacy non-prefixed URLs
(`/portfolio/foo/`, `/services/x/`, etc.) are 308-redirected to `/en/...`
in `public/_redirects` (Cloudflare Pages only).

### Polymorphic content schema

Translatable fields accept **either** a plain string (legacy / single-language
content) **or** a `{ en, hu }` object:

```yaml
title: Hotel Lycium                    # plain string — treated as default-locale
title:                                 # localized object — both locales
  en: Hotel Lycium
  hu: Lycium Hotel
```

This means **all existing single-language MDX still validates unchanged**.
New translated content uses the object form. The `localizedString()` helper
in `src/content/config.ts` accepts both.

Translatable fields by collection:
- **Projects** — title, displayTitle, description, story, tasks, tour360.title, films.title, images.alt
- **Services** — title, description, tagline, startRequirements, pricing, sidebarLabel, sidebarContent
- **Articles** — title, excerpt
- **Vision-Tech** — title, description, body[]
- **Reference collections** (categories, client-types, clients, designers, cities, countries) — title

Per-block (MDX components) translatable props:
- `SectionBanner` — label, title, imageAlt
- `SingleImage` — alt, caption
- `ImageGallery` — title (gallery title only; per-image alt is per-block-mapper TBD)
- `Tour360`, `YoutubeEmbed`, `FilmEmbed` — title

### Site runtime — `src/lib/i18n.ts`

```ts
LOCALES                               // ['en', 'hu']
DEFAULT_LOCALE                        // 'en'
t(value, lang)                        // resolve Localized<T> → T | undefined (falls back to default locale)
tStr(value, lang)                     // same as t() but returns '' instead of undefined
localeUrl(path, lang)                 // '/portfolio/foo' + 'hu' → '/hu/portfolio/foo/'
swapLocale(pathname, lang)            // change locale segment in current URL
localeFromPath(pathname)              // parse first segment, default to DEFAULT_LOCALE
staticLocalePaths()                   // getStaticPaths() helper for pages with no other dynamic params
localizedPaths(items, paramsOf)       // cartesian product locales × items, for [slug] etc.
```

### `<Lang>` component for prose blocks in MDX

`src/components/i18n/Lang.astro` — slot-based component that renders only when its
`code` prop matches the active locale. Used inside MDX bodies for prose that needs
per-locale variants:

```mdx
<ProjectStory>
  <Lang code="en">
  Background paragraph in English.
  </Lang>
  <Lang code="hu">
  Háttér bekezdés magyarul.
  </Lang>
</ProjectStory>
```

Page templates must register `Lang` in the `<Content components={{ ... }}>` prop
to make it available inside MDX. Already wired into the portfolio template.

### Page templates — required boilerplate

Every page under `src/pages/[lang]/` does:

```ts
const { lang, slug } = Astro.params as { lang: Locale; ... };
Astro.locals.lang = lang;
const L = ui(lang);                          // UI strings for this locale
const titleStr = tStr(data.title, lang);     // resolve any localized field
const refTitle = tStr(refEntry?.data.title, lang);  // resolve refs
```

All internal links use `localeUrl('/portfolio/foo', lang)` — never bare `/portfolio/foo`.
React islands MUST receive plain strings (use `tStr()` to flatten before crossing
the server/client boundary; React throws on object children).

### UI strings — `src/i18n/strings.ts`

Hardcoded labels (nav, CTAs, section headings, footer columns) live here keyed by
locale. EN and HU objects are TypeScript-checked for structural equality so a
missing key in HU is a compile error. Use `ui(lang).nav.portfolio` etc.

Content from MDX frontmatter is resolved via `t()` separately — that's a
different path (per-document data, not chrome).

### Language switcher

`src/components/layout/LangSwitcher.astro` — chip toggle (EN | HU) in the header
desktop controls and mobile nav. Pure HTML, no JS, server-renders correct hrefs
via `swapLocale(currentPath, targetLocale)`.

### VG Editor — localized fields

The editor inspector renders fields marked translatable as a **`LocalizedTextField`**:
two stacked inputs (EN | HU), with a per-locale **✦ Translate** button on non-default
locales. Currently localized in the editor UI:

- **MetaPanel (frontmatter)** — title, displayTitle, description, story, tasks,
  tagline, sidebarLabel, sidebarContent, startRequirements, pricing (all collection types)
- **Block inspector** — SectionBanner (label, title, imageAlt), SingleImage (alt, caption),
  ImageGallery (title), Tour360/YoutubeEmbed/FilmEmbed (title)

When you write to a non-default locale on a previously-scalar field, the value is
auto-promoted to a `{ en, hu }` object preserving the existing string under `en`.
When all non-default-locale entries become empty again, the value collapses back
to a plain string. This keeps untranslated content simple in the YAML/MDX.

The codegen emits localized props as JSX object literals:
```mdx
<SectionBanner label={{"en":"Interior","hu":"Belső"}} title={{"en":"Lobby","hu":"Lobby"}} />
```
And localized frontmatter as block-style YAML:
```yaml
title:
  en: Hotel Lycium
  hu: Lycium Hotel
```

The block-mapper round-trips both back into `{ en, hu }` JS objects via the existing
`new Function()` JSX-expression evaluator (no parser changes required).

### Translation engine — editor server `/api/translate`

`POST /api/translate` body: `{ text, from, to, engine?, model? }` →
`{ translation, engine, model }`.

`POST /api/translate/batch` for multiple strings in one request (sequential
internally).

Engine selection (set in **AI Settings → Translation**):
- **`ollama`** (default) — uses `ollamaBase` URL + `translationOllamaModel`
  (auto-picks llama3 if unset). Free, local, fast; quality on Hungarian is mediocre
  unless you run a 70B+ model.
- **`claude`** — uses Anthropic Messages API. **API key MUST be in
  `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** — NOT stored in `editor-config.json` (that file
  is checked into git). Set it in your shell or a `.env` file consumed by the editor
  server start script. Quality is excellent for Hungarian; cost is negligible for a
  small site (~$0.01 per page).

The system prompt template is editable in **AI Settings → Translation → System prompt**.
Placeholders `{{from}}` and `{{to}}` are substituted with locale display names.

### Reference collections translation

Curated Hungarian translations for `categories` and `client-types` collections
applied via `scripts/translate-reference-collections.mjs`. These collections
have small fixed vocabularies; running the script once populates `title:
{en, hu}` objects in every YAML file. Cities, countries, clients, designers
stay as-is (proper nouns).

### Adding a new locale (e.g. `de`)

1. **`src/lib/i18n.ts`** — append `'de'` to `LOCALES`; add display name to
   `LOCALE_NAMES`/`LOCALE_SHORT`.
2. **`src/content/config.ts`** — add `de: z.string().optional()` to the
   `localizedString()` object branch.
3. **`tools/editor/client/src/lib/localized.ts`** — append `'de'` to `LOCALES`.
4. **`astro.config.mjs`** — append `'de'` to `i18n.locales`.
5. **`src/i18n/strings.ts`** — add a sibling `de` object mirroring the EN shape.
6. **`scripts/translate-reference-collections.mjs`** — add `de` translations
   for category/client-type titles, regenerate.
7. **`tools/editor/server/routers/translate.ts`** — add `de: 'German'` to
   `LOCALE_NAMES` for the system prompt substitution.
8. Translate UI labels in `src/components/layout/Header.astro`,
   `Footer.astro`, and any home-page hardcoded copy.

The schema, codegen, block-mapper, and editor inspector all auto-pick up the
new locale — no further structural changes required.

Images are NOT in Git. They live in R2 bucket `visiongraphics-images`.
Public R2 URL: `https://pub-681025dcca3b4bad99aa4a4d65ecc023.r2.dev`

URL structure:
- Portfolio images: `/_img/portfolio/[project-slug]/[filename]` → 302 redirect → R2
- Service images:  `/_img/services/[slug]/[filename]` → 302 redirect → R2
- Article images:  `/_img/articles/[slug]/[filename]` → 302 redirect → R2
- Tech images:     `/_img/vision-tech/[slug]/[filename]` → 302 redirect → R2
- Root images:     `/hero-bg.jpg` etc. → 302 redirect → R2 root

Redirects defined in `public/_redirects` (Cloudflare Pages only).
Dev proxy in `astro.config.mjs` (`r2DevProxy`) handles `/_img/*` locally by fetching from R2.

R2 bucket path structure (no `_img/` prefix inside bucket):
- `portfolio/<slug>/<file>`, `services/<slug>/<file>`, `articles/<slug>/<file>`, `vision-tech/<slug>/<file>`

To upload images: use VG Editor image picker → "↑ R2" button (calls rclone via editor server API).
All uploads go to R2 via the editor. `upload-images.bat` is retired.

### 360 Tour Hosting (`pano.visiongraphics.eu`)

Pano2VR 360° tours are NOT served from Cloudflare Pages. They live on
the tarhely shared host under `/public_html/PANO/`, exposed via the
subdomain `pano.visiongraphics.eu` (DocRoot points to `/PANO/`).

URL pattern in MDX: `https://pano.visiongraphics.eu/<TOUR_SLUG>/`
(no `/PANO/` segment — the subdomain is rooted there).

Backward compatibility: `public/_redirects` 301-redirects any old
`visiongraphics.eu/PANO/X/` request to `pano.visiongraphics.eu/X/`,
so external links shared in the past keep working.

### Thumbnails

Thumbnails are WebP files stored in `public/thumbs/` locally and in R2 under `thumbs/`.
They are **not committed to git** — generated locally, pushed to R2 via "↑ R2 all", served via `_redirects`.

**Sizes:**
- `card`  — 600px wide — portfolio grid, service cards, article cards, gallery thumbnail strip
- `large` — 1600px wide — gallery main viewer, lightbox fallback

**Path structure:**
```
public/thumbs/card/<collection>/<slug>/filename.webp
public/thumbs/large/<collection>/<slug>/filename.webp
```
Collections: `portfolio`, `services`, `articles`, `vision-tech`

**Generating thumbnails:**
```bash
node scripts/generate-thumbs.mjs                          # all images (R2 + staging)
node scripts/generate-thumbs.mjs --slug portfolio/hotel-lycium  # single folder
node scripts/generate-thumbs.mjs --force                  # regenerate existing
```
Sources: R2 bucket (all 4 collections) + `tools/editor/.staging/` (locally staged images).
Output goes to `public/thumbs/` (local only — not committed). Run before "↑ R2 all" in the editor.

**`thumbUrl(src, size?)` — `src/lib/image-url.ts`:**
```ts
thumbUrl('/_img/portfolio/slug/01.jpg')          // → /thumbs/card/portfolio/slug/01.webp
thumbUrl('/_img/services/slug/01.jpg', 'large')  // → /thumbs/large/services/slug/01.webp
thumbUrl(undefined)                              // → '' (safe — projects without coverImage)
```
Default size is `'card'`. Gallery main viewer uses `'large'`. Lightbox fullscreen uses the original `src` directly.
`src` accepts `string | undefined | null` — returns `''` for falsy input. Always filter out
empty strings before rendering `<img>` tags.

### Contact Form

The `/contact/` form posts to **`/api/contact`**, a Cloudflare Pages Function defined
in `functions/api/contact.ts`. The function validates the payload, runs the honeypot
check, and forwards the message as email via the **Resend** API.

**Required Cloudflare Pages env vars** (Settings → Environment variables → Production):

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | API key from resend.com — set as a **secret** |
| `CONTACT_TO` | `info@visiongraphics.hu` |
| `CONTACT_FROM` | `contact@visiongraphics.hu` (must be on a Resend-verified domain) |

**One-time Resend setup:**
1. Create a Resend account, add `visiongraphics.hu` as a sending domain.
2. Add the DKIM/SPF DNS records Resend provides to the `visiongraphics.hu` zone.
3. Wait for verification (usually < 5 min once DNS propagates).
4. Generate an API key, paste into the `RESEND_API_KEY` Pages secret.

**Local testing** (optional — function does not run under `astro dev`):
```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler pages dev dist \
  --binding RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx \
  --binding CONTACT_TO=info@visiongraphics.hu \
  --binding CONTACT_FROM=contact@visiongraphics.hu
```

The Pages Function lives **outside** Astro's `src/` tree and is bundled by Cloudflare's
build step automatically — no Astro config changes needed. The static build (`output:
'static'`) is unaffected.

## Design System

### Aesthetic Direction
**Dark luxury editorial** (default). Light mode available via toggle — warm off-white, not clinical white.

### Theme System
- Toggle: `src/components/ui/ThemeToggle.astro` — sun/moon button in header (desktop + mobile nav)
- Switching: sets `document.documentElement.dataset.theme = 'light'` / removes it for dark
- Persistence: `localStorage` key `vg-theme`; fallback to `prefers-color-scheme`
- Flash prevention: inline `<script is:inline>` in `Base.astro` `<head>` applies theme before first paint
- Light mode tokens defined under `[data-theme="light"]` in `global.css`

### Color Palette (`src/styles/global.css`)

Dark mode (default `:root`):
```css
--color-bg: #1a1a1a;   --color-surface: #121212;  --color-surface-2: #0f0f0f;
--color-border: #333333;  --color-accent: #da1313;
--color-text: #f0f0f1;  --color-text-muted: #c8c8c8;  --color-text-faint: #8a8a8a;
--color-header-bg: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.95);
```

Light mode (`[data-theme="light"]`):
```css
--color-bg: #f7f5f2;   --color-surface: #eeeae5;  --color-surface-2: #e5e1da;
--color-border: #d0cbc3;  --color-accent: #c41010;
--color-text: #18160f;  --color-text-muted: #47433b;  --color-text-faint: #8a8075;
--color-header-bg: rgba(247, 245, 242, 0.95);
```

**`--color-header-bg`** — use this variable for the header background, NOT a hardcoded rgba. It automatically switches between themes.

### Layout

- Max content width: **2400px** (`.container`)
- Fluid via single clamp: `html { font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.737rem + 0.842vw, 2rem) }`
- Never use static breakpoint overrides for font sizes or spacing

### Typography

**Work Sans** exclusively.

```css
--fs-h1: 2.986rem;  --fs-h2: 2.488rem;  --fs-h3: 2.074rem;
--fs-h4: 1.728rem;  --fs-h5: 1.44rem;   --fs-h6: 1.2rem;
--fs-body: 1rem;    --fs-small: 0.833rem;  --fs-xs: 0.694rem;
```

### Spacing Scale

```css
--space-1: 0.25rem;  --space-2: 0.5rem;   --space-4: 1rem;
--space-6: 1.5rem;   --space-8: 2rem;     --space-12: 3rem;
--space-16: 4rem;    --size-header: 4.5rem;  --size-logo: 2.25rem;
```

### Global CSS Gotchas

**`p { max-width: 65ch }`** — `global.css` applies a global max-width to all `<p>` elements.
Any page template that uses full-width prose (MDX body content, etc.) must override this with
`max-width: none` in its scoped `p` selector. Example:
```css
.my-body-content :global(p) { max-width: none; }
```
Without this override, body paragraphs sit narrow inside a wide container while block components
(ProcessFlow, SpecTable, tables, etc.) span full width — creating an inconsistent layout.

## Site Structure

**Nav:** driven by `src/data/nav-config.json` — edit via VG Editor → Pages tab or directly in the file.
Currently enabled: Portfolio · Services · Technologies · About · Contact
Currently disabled: FAQ · Pricing · Blog (toggle on when pages are ready)

```
src/pages/
  index.astro
  portfolio/index.astro, [slug].astro, category/[cat].astro
  services/index.astro, [slug].astro
  vision-tech/index.astro, [slug].astro
  articles/index.astro, [slug].astro
  faq/index.astro

## Component Architecture

```
src/components/
  layout/    Header.astro, Footer.astro, Nav.astro, MobileNav.tsx
  ui/        Button.astro, Tag.astro, SectionLabel.astro, SectionBanner.astro, ThemeToggle.astro
  portfolio/ PortfolioGrid.astro, PortfolioFilter.tsx, ProjectCard.astro, ProjectGallery.astro
  media/     Tour360.astro, FilmEmbed.astro, YouTubeEmbed.astro, ImageLightbox.tsx,
             ArticleGalleryMounter.tsx, ArticleImageCompareMounter.tsx
  mdx/       SectionBanner.astro, ImageGallery.astro, ImageCompare.astro,
             DeliverableGrid.astro, TimelineTable.astro, NotableGrid.astro,
             ProcessFlow.astro, PhaseMatrix.astro, SpecTable.astro, CompareTable.astro,
             ProjectDescription.astro, ProjectStory.astro, ProjectTasks.astro

`src/components/ui/SectionBanner.astro` = page-level hero/section divider (used in templates).
`src/components/mdx/SectionBanner.astro` = in-body banner (used via MDX content files).

## Content Collection Schemas

See `src/content/config.ts` for full Zod schemas.

### Projects (MDX)
Frontmatter fields: title, displayTitle, year, description (SEO/cards only),
client (reference), designer (reference), city (reference), country (reference),
clientType (reference), categories (array of references), features (array),
techniques (array of vision-tech slugs), services (array of service slugs),
tags (array), coverImage, has360 (boolean), hasFilm (boolean), published, featured.

**`services` field** — which services this project demonstrates. Used for bidirectional
service↔project navigation: service pages show a carousel of projects that list them.
Set via the Keystatic multiselect or VG Editor Projects overview. Valid values match
the service collection slugs: `architectural-visualization`, `product-visualization`,
`large-scale-projects`, `advanced-ai-services`, `workflow-optimization`,
`3ds-max-tools`, `custom-rendering`.

**`story` and `tasks` are NO LONGER frontmatter fields.** They live in the MDX body
as `<ProjectStory>` and `<ProjectTasks>` children components.

**MDX body order (standard):**
1. `<ProjectTasks>` — what was done
2. `<ImageGallery>` / `<Tour360>` / `<FilmEmbed>` / `<YoutubeEmbed>` — media
3. `<ProjectStory heading="The Story:">` — background narrative (at the end)

Gallery/compare require `ArticleGalleryMounter` + `ArticleImageCompareMounter` client islands.

**Portfolio page layout** (`[slug].astro`):
- **"The Project:"** (red heading) → description text → data line (Field / Date / Location / Client / Architect)
- **"The Task:"** (red heading) → techniques bar (`|` separated) → services bar (links to service pages) → MDX body content
- **"The Story:"** (red heading, editable per project) → story text — rendered by `<ProjectStory>`

The services bar only renders when `services` frontmatter is non-empty.

**Filter detection:** `has360` and `hasFilm` are manual boolean checkboxes in the editor.
Tick them when adding a `<Tour360>` or `<FilmEmbed>`/`<YoutubeEmbed>` to a project.

**Valid category values:** `architectural-visualization`, `residential`, `commercial`,
`office`, `airport`, `infrastructure`, `urban`, `hospitality`, `industrial`,
`product-visualization`, `vr-experience`, `animation`, `exhibition`,
`education`, `healthcare`, `sports`, `civic`, `agriculture`, `renovation`, `transportation`

**YAML gotcha:** If `description` contains a colon followed by a space, wrap in double
quotes or use a block scalar (`|`).

### Services (MDX)
Frontmatter: title, description, tagline, bannerImage, order, published,
startRequirements, pricing, sidebarLabel, sidebarContent, techniques (array of vision-tech slugs).
MDX body: SectionBanner, DeliverableGrid, TimelineTable, NotableGrid, ImageGallery, ImageCompare,
ProcessFlow, PhaseMatrix, Tour360, YoutubeEmbed.

Note: the reverse link (which projects belong to this service) comes from the **project's** `services`
array — there is no `services` field on the service schema itself.

**Service detail page layout** (`src/pages/services/[slug].astro`):
- Full-width, no sidebar. Layout: banner → breadcrumb → tagline → meta strip → MDX body → techniques chips → related projects carousel → CTAs.
- **Meta strip** — horizontal flex row showing `pricing`, `startRequirements`, and optionally `sidebarLabel`+`sidebarContent`. Only renders when at least one field exists.
- **Techniques chip row** — rendered from `techniques` frontmatter array (vision-tech slugs). Links to `/vision-tech/[slug]/`.
- **Related projects carousel** — projects whose `services` array includes this service slug. Drag-to-scroll, gradient overlay cards.
- **`DeliverableGrid` `href` prop** — optional; when provided, the card title becomes a link (use for vision-tech cross-links).

**ServicesTabs active indicator** — uses `shadow-[inset_3px_0_0_var(--color-accent)]`, NOT `border-l-*`. Reason: `border-none` on the button element suppresses all border-style, making border-l invisible.

### Vision-Tech (MDX)
Frontmatter: title, description, image, technique, cost, model3d, complexity, reality,
purpose (array), gallery (array of image URLs), relatedCategories (array), relatedFeatures (array),
published (boolean, default true).

`published: false` hides the page from the index and redirects the slug to `/vision-tech/`.
Currently hidden: `cultural-context-integration` (no real projects yet).

**Two AI-only tech pages link to an external platform:**
- `ai-animation` — AI video from stills, links to [ai.visiongraphics.eu](https://ai.visiongraphics.eu)
- `ai-render-upgrade` — photorealistic variations from existing renders, links to [ai.visiongraphics.eu](https://ai.visiongraphics.eu)

**Vision-tech page template** (`src/pages/vision-tech/[slug].astro`) registers:
`Tour360`, `FilmEmbed`, `YouTubeEmbed`, `YoutubeEmbed` (alias), `ImageCompare`, `ImageGallery`,
`ProcessFlow`, `SpecTable`, `CompareTable` — plus `ArticleGalleryMounter` and
`ArticleImageCompareMounter` as client islands.

**Body text sizing in vision-tech template:** paragraphs and list items use `var(--fs-body)` (not
`var(--fs-small)`), and `max-width: none` overrides the global `p { max-width: 65ch }` rule.

### Articles (MDX)
Frontmatter: title, date, excerpt, tags, coverImage, published.
MDX body: prose + SectionBanner, ImageGallery, ImageCompare.

### Reference Collections
clients, designers, cities, countries, client-types, categories — title field only.
Managed via Keystatic. Used as `reference()` in projects schema.

---

## Portfolio Filter

`src/components/portfolio/PortfolioFilter.tsx` — React island (`client:load`).
Filters: category multi-select, features multi-select, year range, text search,
360 toggle, film toggle, sort. All AND logic. State in URL params.

360/film toggles read `has360` / `hasFilm` boolean fields from frontmatter (not derived
from MDX body). Set these manually in the editor when a project has tours or films.

## Keeping CLAUDE.md Current

This file is the single source of truth for how the project works. **Update it whenever:**
- A workflow changes (editors, image upload, deployment, thumbnail generation)
- A new MDX component is added or an existing one is renamed/removed
- A content schema field is added, removed, or repurposed
- A new tool, script, or npm command is introduced
- A hard rule is added or relaxed
- The site structure or URL patterns change
- A best practice is established through trial and error (especially "we got burned by X")

Updates should be made **in the same commit** as the code change they document.
If Claude made the change, Claude updates this file. If you made the change manually, note it here.

## DO NOT / HARD RULES

1. No fake testimonials.
2. No raw AI prompts as visible text.
3. No newsletter widget anywhere.
4. No `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` — use URL params.
5. No `<form>` tags in React components.
6. No WordPress patterns.
7. No personal project links (FakeHistory.eu) on main site.
8. No FTP — GitHub → Cloudflare Pages only.
9. Work Sans exclusively — no other fonts.
10. No hardcoded font-size or spacing — use `var(--fs-*)` and `var(--space-*)`.
11. Vimeo: facade pattern only — never auto-embed iframe on page load.
12. 360 tours: click-to-load — never auto-load iframe.
13. Contact page required at /contact/.
14. Services are content collection files — no static `.astro` service pages.
15. MDX components must be passed via `<Content components={{...}} />`.
